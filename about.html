    <section>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Gloves Up Boxing Gym was founded to provide a safe haven for young people in vulnerable
        communities. What started as a small initiative to keep kids off the streets has grown into a
        movement of mentorship, discipline, and empowerment. Through boxing, we teach life skills,
        resilience, and self-belief.

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Our vision is to create a network of youth boxing hubs across Cape Town, each one becoming a
        beacon of safety and transformation. We believe in building communities one child at a time,
        showing that with guidance and opportunity, tomorrow can look very different from yesterday.

            Once caught in the pull of gangs and juvenile detention, Kelvin turned his hardships into
            purpose. Today, he leads Gloves Up with passion, showing children that they can rise above
            their circumstances.
